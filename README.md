#RoughSets - reducts and core
##Created by Mateusz Walendziuk during 4.07.2016 and 10.07.2016

I've created this project because I had to do something similar at the end 4th semester on "Artificial Intelligence" at Białystok University of Technology.
I didn't even try to make it in proper deadline, so I decided to do it during lazy summer days.

##What is this program/app/whatever about
The program is trying to get all reducts and the core from the decision table saved in csv format. 
Attributes must be divided by comma separator (",")
As I've heard, this is a quite difficult to optimize such operation (that's why it might work really slow when loading a huge csv decision table into the program).

##End
I don't think anybody will need such app when there's R gui that works surely better (except wrong core detection), but I tried all my best to make this app working well.
I'm grateful for all help and especially listening to my complaints about the app I made  - Kamil, Przemysław and Tomasz, thank you.
